Trying to build a simple text based web browser in the terminal with Vim inspired controls.
Let's see how far it goes.

## Controls:
- j/k -> scroll the page
- Ctrl+p -> enter URL
- Esc/q/Ctrl+c -> exit
- Ctrl+t -> new tab
- d -> close current tab
- Tab -> next tab
- Alt+Tab -> previous tab

## TODO:
- Make links work
- Add help screen
- Render HTML elements correctly
- Write tests for and improve the HTML parser
